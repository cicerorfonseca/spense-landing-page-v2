# Spense Landing Page

Spense is a landing page for writers. A great Codewell challenge for practicing absolute positioning and flex layouts.

This is a version 2.0 of the Codewell challenge, not available on Codewell website.

The version 1.0 is the Codewell challenge and could have delivered using plain HTML/CSS/JS but I opted to build it using React having the versaion 2.0 in mind.

The version 2.0 will have all routes implemented and new features added that are not in the original challenge.

I also choose to use SASS especially to nest styles and creating mixins for buttons and shared styling.

I used normalize.css from Nicolas Gallagher - github.com/necolas/normalize.css - to add CSS resets and normalize styles browser-wide.
